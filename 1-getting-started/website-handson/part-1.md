# Getting started with your first portfolio - Part 1: Creating `index.html`

  1. Create a directory called `<GH Username>.github.io`
  2. Create a new file called `index.html` under the new directory
  3. Type the following snippet into `index.html`

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <meta charset="utf-8" />
      <title>My Portfolio</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>Hello! My name is [name] ✌️</h1>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

  4. Now, we are going to see how our code looks on the browser. In your terminal, navigate to your `<GH Username>.github.io` directory, and type in `open index.html` - this will allow you to see your changes by automatically opening a tab on your browser for your html file.
  1. Alternatively: open Chrome, and press `Ctrl + O` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + O` on Mac to open the file explorer dialog box. Then, navigate to your `<GH Username>.github.io` directory and open the `index.html` file
  1. You will see something like this on your browser
    <p align="center">
    <img width="400" alt="Example of intro text" src="/images/website-handson/part-1/1-intro.png">
    </p>
  2. When you make any changes to `index.html`, you can refresh the newly-opened tab to see your changes. Add the following into the `h1` tag:

  ```html
  <h1>Hello! My name is [name] ✌️, welcome to my portfolio :)</h1>
  ```

  7. When you refresh the page, you should see
    <p align="center">
    <img width="400" alt="Example of modified intro text" src="/images/website-handson/part-1/2-intro-modified.png">
    </p>
