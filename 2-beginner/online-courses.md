[**edX**](https://www.edx.org): You may know of edX from UBC's infamous [CPSC 110](https://edge.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UBC+CPSC110+2020S/course/), but it also houses a plethora of MOOCs from schools like Harvard and Berkeley! Some great CS courses are [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science) and [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-with-python), although we recommend you check out all of the different courses or course streams that are available on your own!

OCW contains full course recordings of MIT lectures for free, but much of the material given is intended for a course format, so it may not be the best place to go to start learning.
